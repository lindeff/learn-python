Exercise: guess my number
In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, 
the computer will guess the user's secret number!
"""

low = 0
high = 100
print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
guess = int((low + high) / 2)
print("Is your secret number " + str(guess) + "?")
ans = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
while ans != "c":
    if ans == "h":
        high = guess
        guess = int((low + high) / 2)
    elif ans == "l":
        low = guess
        guess = int((low + high) / 2)
    else:
        print("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
    print("Is your secret number " + str(guess) + "?")
    ans = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
print("Game over. Your secret number was: " + str(guess))
